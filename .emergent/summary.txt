<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially asked about the agent's coding constraints. Subsequently, the user provided a detailed and evolving set of requirements to build a high-end, production-ready homepage for a fictional entity, 'Digital Dream Works Agency'.

The requirements evolved over several iterations:
1.  **Initial Prompt:** Build a Next.js homepage with a dark-mode, minimalist aesthetic, featuring a  3D hero element, specific SEO/Schema markup, and detailed content structure.
2.  **Iteration 2 (Visual Reference):** The user provided a screenshot of a more sophisticated design with purple/pink gradients, which the agent implemented.
3.  **Iteration 3 (Code Reference 1):** The user provided a  file () from  with a red/orange theme, which the agent replicated.
4.  **Iteration 4 (Code Reference 2):** The user provided a premium version () with a hero slider and purple/blue gradients, which the agent also implemented.
5.  **Final Request (Current Task):** The user uploaded  and instructed the agent to **update the existing website** with the new content and components from this archive, specifically instructing **not to start from scratch**. The key updates include new slides with Google/Meta Ads data, a new  component, and updated content across several sections.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A fully functional, standalone Next.js (App Router) frontend application for the 'Digital Dream Works Agency' homepage. The project uses TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and . The codebase reflects the premium design from the fourth iteration, featuring a hero slider. The agent has extracted the final code provided by the user and has begun the process of applying the required updates to the existing components.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was updating the existing website to match the final design and content provided in . It has successfully updated three files: , , and .
*   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
*   **Agent Testing Done:** N
*   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. After all files are updated, the agent should first perform a visual check using the screenshot tool, and then run the frontend testing agent for a comprehensive review.
*   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending bugs or issues. The primary focus is on completing the in-progress update task.

**In progress Task List**:
*   **Task 1: Complete the website update with the final design and content.** (Priority: P0)
    *   **Where to resume:** The agent has updated , , and . The next step is to update the remaining files based on the extracted  archive. This involves:
        1.  Creating the new  component.
        2.  Updating .
        3.  Updating .
        4.  Updating .
        5.  Updating the main page  to integrate the new  component and reflect any other structural changes.
    *   **What will be achieved with this?** The website will exactly match the final version provided by the user, featuring new performance data in the slider, a new trust-building component, and updated pricing and messaging.
    *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    *   **Blocked on something:** No

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Future Tasks:**
    *   **Implement solution sub-pages (P1):** The user explicitly mentioned that sub-pages for services like Logistics, Healthcare, etc. (e.g., ) would be built in a future sprint. The current links are placeholders.

**Completed work in this session**
*   Set up a standalone Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
*   Implemented multiple, full-page redesigns based on user-provided visual references and code archives.
*   Integrated Swiper.js for carousels,  for animations, and  for icons.
*   Configured a light/dark mode theme toggle using .
*   Structured the project for i18n (EN, ES, IT), populating the English content.
*   Successfully ran comprehensive tests using the testing agent after major implementations to ensure quality and responsiveness.
*   Created and maintained a  document.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
*   None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
*   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
*   **Frontend Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router), React, TypeScript.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with a plugin for custom animations and theming via CSS variables.
*   **Animation:**  for scroll-based and entrance animations.
*   **UI Libraries:**  for sliders/carousels,  for icons.
*   **Theming:** Light/Dark mode implemented with .
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** Project is structured for multiple locales, though only English is implemented.

**key DB schema**
*   Not applicable. This is a frontend-only application.

**changes in tech stack**
*   The project is a standalone Next.js application, as requested by the user, which deviates from the system prompt's default React/FastAPI/MongoDB full-stack architecture.

**All files of reference**
*   **Files to be modified:**
    *   
    *   
    *   
    *   
*   **File to be created:**
    *   
*   **Key existing files:**
    *   : Root layout.
    *   : Main hero component.
    *   : Defines the design system (colors, fonts).
    *   : Manages dependencies and scripts.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
*    may contain leftover dependencies from earlier 3D experiments (e.g., , ). These could be removed for better hygiene, but it's a low-priority task.

**key api endpoints**
*   Not applicable.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
*   **Follow the final artifact:** Your primary goal is to update the existing codebase to perfectly match the contents of . Do not start from scratch or introduce new design elements.
*   **Standalone Next.js project:** The entire application is a Next.js frontend. There is no backend component in this repository. The user's plan is to deploy this to Vercel.
*   **User is design-centric:** The user has a very specific visual goal. Pay close attention to matching the design, layout, and content from the provided files exactly.
